## Design sketch v1.0

**Problem:** hard to build. **Solution:** Turn into panels (front, side, and back panels). Also, there's no door to the right yet.



## Design sketch v1.1

Updated design has 6 panels.

* 1 front panel
* 3 side panels
* 2 top panels

## Design Sketch v1.2

**Further simplified:** 

* lower and top box are constructed separately
* 6 different panel types (each type has the same dimensions) make up the whole catio. 10 panels total. (2 panels have hinged doors.)

The top cage could be lifted off, if attached with some kind of pin and hook system, for example.

An exploded view shows that panel type A (28x48'') makes up almost all of the top part, and is used once in the lower part.

# Individual panel dimensions



## Panel A

To make clamping easier, the panel has been slightly updated so that all horizontal pieces have the same length (26 inches).

## Panel B



Panel B is basically Panel A with a small door.

## Panel C

Panel C is comprised of a large rectangular frame, with a small door at the lower left.
